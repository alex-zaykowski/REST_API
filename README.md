# Job Locator
This is a simple REST api built using Node.js. The goal is to make job searching easier for candidates by filtering 
by location. Right now many websites like LinkedIn and Indeed don't really seems to do a good job of this, you will be smothered with 
"promoted" jobs and miss ones that may be local to you or in a certain area you're looking for.
