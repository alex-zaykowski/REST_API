# Job Locator
This is a simple REST api built using Node.js. The goal is to make job searching easier for candidates by filtering 
by location. Right now many websites like LinkedIn and Indeed don't really seems to do a good job of this, you will be smothered with 
"promoted" jobs and miss ones that may be local to you or in a certain area you're looking for. 

# Objective
This isn't meant to look pretty by including any new front-end frameworks (i.e. React, Gatsby, ect.) it's rather just an exercise with Node.js and API requests. After this is complete I plan to either add to it by including a better front-end or move on to a more complex project.

# API
## Adzuna
- API for aggregating job postings [more information on it here](https://developer.adzuna.com/)

# Frameworks
- For this project I'm just using Node.js and Express
